# StarkWidgets

Welcome to our interpretation of the widgets app! An app we have decided to finish and polish up during our journey as
app academy students. It took us quite a few hours over a two day period and we are quite proud of what we have to show.

We have a few bonus implementations that we plan to add when when we have the time. Hopefully they will give you the 'wow'
factor that we think it will bring. (hint: I don't feel so well mr. Stark...)

Things we learned:
1. How to debug both an API call and debug react by following the 'waterfall' flow of react.
2. How to better set & update the state, pass down props through multiple components.
3. How to add a CSS library such as normalize to our app.
4. Becoming better at utilizing event handlers with react logic.
5. How to use the weather API with react & how to create our own autofill in react.
6. CSS! Learned a lot about styling and how fun it can actually be!

& much more!
